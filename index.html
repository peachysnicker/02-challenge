            <h2>Minimal Lighting in Bedroom</h2>
            <p>
                As obvious as it may seem to want darkness in the bedroom to have a proper night of sleep, that is not
                always the case. Consider the bright street lamps outside of your house that could be potientially
                disrupting your sleep. What do you think about when you think of a dog den? Yes! Darkeness! Take some
                time to check your bedroom to see if there are any possibly light disruptors that could be potentially
                affecting your sleep.

            <h2>Don't Eat too Much Food Before Bed</h2>
            <p>
                Just as your dog has a structured feeding schedule, so should you. It is best practice to limit late
                night snacks or even late dinners. Eating too close to when it is time to sleep can cause your body to
                work harder at digesting your food rather than sleeping. I love my late night treats but do yourself a
                favour and eat no closer than two hours before bedtime.

            <h2>Read Before Bed</h2>
            <p>
                Put down the iphone! As much as we love to check our phone before sleep, possibly scrolling instagram or
                facebook, it is not a good habit!
                Instead of reading the web, pick up a book! Twenty minutes of reading can be all your body needs to
                settle down from the stressors of the day. You don't typically see dogs scrolling endlessly online
                instead of sleeping!

            <p>
                You may be asking yourself why we should follow the sleeping habits of dogs? It can be any animal! We
                live busy lives and the number one priority we need to have is to get a proper nights rest.

                The best of all is that it costs nothing to observe a dog sleeping and learn from it! What are you
